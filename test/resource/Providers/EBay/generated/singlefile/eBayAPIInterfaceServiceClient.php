	 * in every result (e.g., for every Item), but no seller-related data. Specifying a detail
	 * level is like using a predefined attribute list in the SELECT clause of an SQL query. Use

 * an array of ProductSearch properties that are configured with a list of search attributes
 * or keywords (and other information), GetProductSearchResults searches an eBay catalog for
 * products that match each query. Some queries can be configured to also specify a sort order
 * for the results.<br> <br> To configure a ProductSearch object to search by attributes, you
 * need a valid combination of search attributes. If you want to use a sort order other than
 * the default order, you also need a valid sort attribute. We offer two calls that return
 * product search and sort attributes. Use GetCategory2CS to determine which one of these calls
 * you can use for a given category. At least one approach is offered for each catalog-enabled
 * category, and some cases, both are offered.<br> <br> <b>GetProductSearchPage</b>: Use this
 * call when you want to configure a simple query that consists of a single search attribute
 * (with a value). This retrieves a single product or a very short list of search results to
 * choose from. Some products are fairly easy to find based on a single attribute. For example,
 * in Consumer Electronics categories (Digital Cameras, Cell Phones, and PDAs), you can specify
 * a unique (or nearly unique) identifier, like a part number. In Media categories (Books,
 * DVDs & Movies, Music, and Video Games), you can specify a descriptive name, like a title.
 * <br> <br> <b>GetProductFinder</b>: Use this call when you want to configure a complex query.
 * In the Sell Your Item flow, this is a complex query against the eBay product catalog. Currently,
 * this type of search is available in Consumer Electronics categories only. In this type of
 * search, you specify values for multiple attributes, like Brand and Resolution (i.e., number
 * of megapixels). This retrieves a list of matching products. This approach is useful when
 * the user does not know the part number, or a product does not have a single, distinguishing
 * feature that is easy to search on. For example, searching for a digital camera based solely
 * on the brand would likely yield far too many results to be useful. Searching on the brand,
 * product line, and resolution will retrieve a much shorter list of results. <br> <br> Alternatively,
 * you can search on a particular keyword that appears in a product's title or Item Specifics. For
 * this, you use GetProductSearchResults and and pass in one or more text strings (with optional
 * wildcards) in ProductSearch.QueryKeywords. <br> <br> When you use a keyword query, the search
 * criteria are not restricted to the results of a product search page or product finder, so
 * the criteria are not tied to a particular characteristic set. This means you can search
 * across multiple characteristic sets using the same query. This is useful when the user wants
 * to broaden their search across multiple categories. For example, a seller who sells Jazz
 * books, Jazz CDs, and Jazz movies may want to search for "Bird" across multiple categories.
 * Specify the characteristic set IDs of interest by using CharacteristicSetIDs. <br> <br> GetProductSearchResults
 * returns a list of matching products, if any. Each product is represented as a list of attributes
 * (Item Specifics) plus other identifying information, such as a product ID and a stock photo.
 * <br> <br> Once the user selects a product from the list (this may require a call to GetProductFamilyMembers
 * to retrieve additional products to choose from), pass its ID in a GetProductSellingPages
 * request to retrieve more detailed information about each product, including a set of optional
 * Item Specifics that the seller can use in addition to the pre-filled Item Specifics (see

 * in the request URL (for the SOAP API) or the X-EBAY-API-SITEID header (for the XML API).
 * For example, if you specify site ID 0, then data for Express US is returned. <br> <br> Currently,
 * this call is only supported for site ID 0 (Express US). <br> <br> The Sandbox does not support
 * GetSearchResultsExpress.<br> <br> You can configure the call to retrieve only the item data,
 * only the catalog product data, only the histogram, or any combination of these results.
 * By default, the call returns brief summaries of each.<br> <br> <b>Item Results:</b> For
 * each item returned (if any), the response includes a brief set of details, such as the item
 * price (including shipping). You can retrieve more or fewer details about each item by using
 * the ItemDetails field. To retrieve other details about a given item, use a call like GetSellerList
 * or GetItem.<br> <br> <b>Catalog Product Results:</b> For each eBay catalog product returned (if
 * any), the response includes a brief set of details, such as the minimum and maximum price
 * of listings that have been pre-filled based on that product. You can retrieve more or fewer
 * details about each product by using the ProductDetails field.<br> <br> <b>Histogram Results:</b>
 * Instead of grouping items by category, the Express search engine groups items into <i>domains</i>.
 * A domain is a set of items to which Express can apply a common set of search rules. Express supports
 * three kinds of domains: <i>Product types</i>, <i>aisles</i>, and <i>departments</i>, like
 * a typical department store. (The fact that we call these "domains" is not important to buyers
 * and sellers, but it can be helpful to understand the domain relationships when you are working
 * with the API.)<br> <br> Listings with similar properties are classified into product type
 * domains. For example, "DVDs & Movies" is a product type domain. Think of a product type
 * as a type of good or service that can be purchased and as a leaf domain (which cannot be
 * the parent of other domains).<br> <br> <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b> An Express product
 * type is not the same as an eBay catalog product. Some Express product types are associated with
 * eBay catalog products, but other Express product types are not.</span> <br> <br> When multiple
 * product types share a common theme, Express groups them into an aisle or a department. For
 * example, the Men's Jeans product type can be grouped with Men's Pants into a Men's Clothing
 * aisle. When multiple aisles share a common theme, Express groups them into departments.
 * For example, the Men's Clothing aisle can be grouped with a Men's Accessories aisle to form
 * an Apparel & Accessories department. If no groups make sense, a product type can stand alone
 * without being grouped. For example, "DVDs & Movies" would not be grouped with other product types
 * like Men's Jeans, so "DVDs & Movies" has no parent aisle or department. (From a user's perspective,
 * this product type is elevated to look like a department, but in the API it is still classified
 * as a product type.) Similarly, an aisle can stand alone without being grouped with other
 * aisles into a department.<br> <br> See the eBay Web Services guide link below for more information
 * about departments, aisles, and product types. </p> <p> This call returns a histogram that
 * shows the number of items and catalog products that were found in each department, aisle,
 * and/or product type that matches your search criteria.<br> <br> The domain names and groupings
 * are subject to change. They are determined by the Express search engine based on the items
 * that are currently listed on Express as well as historical buyer behavior. This means you
 * need to call GetSearchResultsExpress to determine the current domain names and their hierarchical
 * relationships.<br> <br> <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b> A domain is a search notion only.
 * That is, items are not stored in domains on eBay, and domains are not equivalent to eBay
 * categories (although Express may choose to organize and name some domains to match eBay
 * categories).</span> <br> <br> <b>Search Tips:</b></p> <ul> <li>Use either Query, ProductReferenceID,
 * or the ExternalProductID fields to search for specific items and/or products. See the descriptions
 * below for information about using these fields. (Only one of these query formats can be used
 * per request.)</li> <li>Use DepartmentName, AisleName, and/or ProductTypeName to browse or search
 * within a particular domain. You can also specify the value "Express" in DepartmentName to
 * retrieve a complete list of all available department, aisle, and product type names.</li> <li>Use
 * one or more filters like HighestPrice to refine the search.</li> <li>Use sort options like
 * ItemSort to control the order in which the results are returned.</li> <li>Use pagination
 * options like EntriesPerPage to control how many results to return at a time.</li> <li>Use
 * verbose controls like ItemDetails to specify the data to return within each result.</li> </ul> <p>The
 * item results, catalog product results, and histogram results do not provide references to
 * each other. That is, the items don't indicate which domains they were found in, and the
 * histogram doesn't specify which items were counted. However, you can infer these relationships
 * by modifying your search parameters. For example, once you determine which domains match
 * your query, you can call GetSearchResultsExpress again to browse or search each of those
 * domains to find out which items they contain. </p> <p>Applicable to the <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/developercenter/rest/"
