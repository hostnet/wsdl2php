     * is made anonymous, this tag will contain the real ID value only for that bidder, and
     * the seller of an item that the user is bidding on. For all other users, the real ID
     * value will be replaced with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the
     * order of that user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder, UserID
     * = Bidder 3. <br><br> Note that the anonymous bidder ID stays the same for a given auction,

     * then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for both bids as "Bidder 3". However,
     * if that same bidder is the first bidder on a different auction, the bidder will be listed
     * for that auction as "Bidder 1", not "Bidder 3".
